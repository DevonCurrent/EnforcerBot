Admin Bot is an administrator bot for Discord

Discord is a chatroom service for gamers that is similar to Slack, Skype, or TeamSpeak. We plan to have this bot have privilages in Discord servers that allow to help admin users manage their servers. Examples of this would be to send messages to new users, invite users that are not in the server, kick users, and change the decibel volume of users that are speaking too loud into audio chatrooms. 

In the first iteration, we setup, initialized, and connected the bot to Discord. The client SacredZoren (Devon Current's account) was also connected to Discord to allow for unit testing. Testing that the Discord bot can be heard on Discord from IntelliJ was also performed.

Features:

*Create greeting messages to new users that join the server that can be customized by admins

*Invite new users to the server that the Admin Bot is in

*Kick abusive/innappropriate users from the server/channel

*Ban and unban users from the server
