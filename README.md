Admin Bot is an administrator bot for Discord

Discord is a chatroom service for gamers that is similar to Slack, Skype, or TeamSpeak. We plan to have this bot have privilages in Discord servers that allow to help admin users manage their servers. Examples of this would be to send messages to new users, invite users that are not in the server, kick users, and change the decibel volume of users that are speaking too loud into audio chatrooms. 

In the first iteration, we setup, initialized, and connected the bot to Discord. The client SacredZoren (Devon Current's account) was also connected to Discord to allow for unit testing. Testing that the Discord bot can be heard on Discord from IntelliJ was also performed.

Features:

*Create greeting messages to new users that join the server that can be customized by admins

*Invite new users to the server that the Admin Bot is in

*Kick abusive/innappropriate users from the server/channel

*Ban and unban users from the server


Future Additions: With our future additions, we would like to implement some simple games such as hangman, a word guessing game, a magic 8 ball to figure out if Stacey will go to the dance with us or not, and possibly a riveting game of tic-tac-toe.


User Stories: Some of the things I would like to see our bot do is if I type !ban @SacredZoren, I would like him to be banned, or if I type !kick @SacredZoren, I would like for him to be temporarily kicked from the server, the long and short of it is, I would like our functions to work properly.


Acceptance Test: We chose a plethora of different Discord administrators from PC, Mac, Linux, to acceptance test our bot, all of them have said that they enjoy the bot so far and would like very much to see the finished project, they however have adressed the inside jokes with a few of our responses and would possibly like to see it more professional.
